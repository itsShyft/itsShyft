- Hi there, I'm Shyft!
- I am somewhat new to programming
- I enjoy a wide variety of games, chatting with friends, reading, and drawing
- I intend to make programs such as mods for games, my own games, and possibly some small but helpful utilities
- Right now, I mostly know Python and use that for most things, but I would like to learn C++/C#, Java, and some more web based things such as CSS, JavaScript, and SQL related things
- I hope that when I release some projects, you'll be able to find something useful!
